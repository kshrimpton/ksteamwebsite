      <b>China</b> is a huge country, with 56 official nationalities and nearly 300 living languages spoken in China today. So it makes sense that Chinese cuisine is just as varied. In fact, ‘Chinese cuisine’ is something of a misnomer as rather than one unified culinary tradition, China is home to numerous provinces which specialise in certain dishes and flavours. <br> Chinese people usually eat together, ordering dishes to share between everyone, with an individual bowl of rice on the side. <br>Below are some personal favourites that are a must when in China!

          <h1>Xiao long bao (Sheau-long-bau) – 小笼包</h1>
          <p>
          <b>What is it?</b> Xiao long bao is a type of steamed bun. They are also known as ‘soup dumplings’ because they are filled with soup – meat, or veggie – and must be eaten very carefully as these little dumplings are served piping hot!<br>
          <b>Where to eat?</b> Xiao long bao are a speciality of the Shanghai region, and you can find them available for any budget, offered by both hole-in-the-wall restaurants and high-end establishments such as Din Tai Fung. <br>
          <b>To note:</b> The best way to eat Xiao long Bao is to bite off the top while holding it in a spoon, and then drink the soup.

        <h1>Mapo Tofu – 麻婆豆腐</h1>
        <p>
        <b>What is it?</b> This is a popular Chinese dish hailing from the Sichuan province – the province known for its love of chillies. The dish consists of tofu cooked in a spicy sauce, along with some minced meat, usually beef. Mapo Tofu is known for its spiciness and its mala (numbing) Sichuan flavour. Not for the faint hearted!<br>
        <b>Where to eat?</b> Although this dish hails from Sichuan, it can be found almost everywhere due to its popularity. It may sometimes appear in the ‘vegetables’ section of the menu as some restaurants consider a dish veggie even if small quantities of meat are present! <br>
        <b>To note:</b> In some menus, this dish can be translated as ‘pockmarked old woman beancurd', as that is its literal translation.

          <h1>Baozi (BAO-zi) – 包子</h1>
          <p>
          <b>What is it?</b> Baozi (or, more affectionately, bao) is another type of steamed bun, but bigger – often the size of a palm – and with more filling than Xiao Long Bao. Baozi dough is made with yeast, making it more bread-like. They are served individually and usually for take-away.<br>
          <b>Where to eat?</b> Chinese markets and convenience stores such as FamilyMart. <br>
          <b>To note:</b> If purchasing in a convenience store, you’ll have to ask the cashier to get one for you. Pointing usually works just as well as fluent Mandarin.

          <h1>Braised Aubergine – 红烧茄子</h1>
          <p>
          <b>What is it?</b> This is one of many delicious veggie dishes that Chinese cuisine has to offer. The aubergine is cooked in a sweet, sticky sauce, bringing out the full flavour of the vegetable. This dish is a hidden gem for aubergine (and vegetable!) lovers. <br>
          <b>Where to eat?</b> Most Chinese restaurants. Usually found in the ‘vegetables’ section of the menu. <br>
          <b>To note:</b> Each restaurant has their own slight variation of this dish, so no two will ever taste the same!
