      <p>
      <b>Japanese</b> food is highly regarded around the world, with dishes such as sushi now commonplace in many Eastern and Western countries. Famed for their healthy diets, Japanese people favour fresh seasonal ingredients, combining white rice with a number of main and side dishes. Seafood is especially abundant in Japanese cuisine, in all its forms. <br>
      Although most restaurants now possess Western-style chairs and tables, some traditional restaurants also use low tables and cushions, usually found on tatami floors, where guests are required to eat seated on the floor.<br>
      Below are four Japanese staple dishes that simply can't be missed.

        <h1>Tonkatsu - 豚カツ / とんかつ</h1>
          <p>
          <b>What is it?</b> Tonkatsu is a pork cutlet coated with panko (bread crumbs) and deep fried in oil, served over a bowl of rice or with vegetables such as shredded cabbage. This dish is sometimes served with Japanese curry -  katsu karē, one of the most popular dishes in Japan. <br>
          <b>Where to eat?</b> Specialised curry restaurants are spread all over Japan, with meaty and veggie varieties available. <br>
          <b>To note:</b> Tonkatsu takes its roots from foreign influence, originating in Japan in the 19th century, when Japan opened itself up to the world after centuries of isolation.

        <h1>Bento - 弁当 / べんとう</h1>
          <p>
          <b>What is it?</b> Bento is a take-out or home-made meal, usually consisting of rice, noodles, meat, fish, cooked or pickled vegetables, intended to be nutritionally balanced. The aesthetics of a bento box is often just as important as the flavours, and elaborate designs based on popular culture or artwork can be expected. <br>
          <b>Where to eat?</b> Bento are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including convenience stores, bento shops (弁当屋 bentō-ya), railway stations, and department stores. Japanese people will often cook their own bento for themselves or their loved ones, filling the container with a variety of dishes. <br>
          <b>To note:</b> Bento is an easy on-the-go snack for busy tourists, available cheaply from convenience stores.

        <h1>Ramen - 拉麺 / ラーメン</h1>
          <p>
          <b>What is it?</b> Ramen translates literally to "pulled noodles". It consists of wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavoured with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori (dried seaweed), menma, and green onions. It is a hearty, filling dish that’s super popular in Japan. <br>
          <b>Where to eat?</b> Ramen is easily found across Japan, though the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist ramen-ya restaurants, which offer mainly ramen.<br>
          <b>To note:</b> Nearly every region in Japan has their own variation of ramen, so why not try them all?
